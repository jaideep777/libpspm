Solvers for Physiologically Structured Population Models

Latest development version: https://github.com/jaideep777/pspm/tree/develop

PSPM is a C++ library to solve Physiologically Structured Population Models.
It implements three methdods to solve PSPMs (Zhang et al. 2017). It supports multiple species.

The three methods are:
1) Fixed Mesh Upwind Method
2) Characteristic Method
3) Escalator Boxcar Train Method

This package includes a demo of simulating the Plant model (Falster et al 2017) using all three methods.
